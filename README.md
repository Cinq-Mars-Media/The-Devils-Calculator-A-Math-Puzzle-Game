The project was built in Ionic 3 and should compile out of the box, though if you wish to download and upload levels to firebase, you'll need to generate your own credentials and put them in enviornment.ts. We'd love to help out or hear your ideas for how to improve the project, so shoot us an email anytime at <A HREF="mailto:devilscalculator@gmail.com">devilscalculator@gmail.com</A><br>

If you simply wish to upload levels, you can build them in the game itself using <a href="https://mathjs.org">Math.js</a> and upload without curation, or submit them for review <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/RkiZUkYgYTETghKr2">here</a>.
